There was once a boy With knives stuck in his voice All he wanted all he wanted was a little affection Until one day he caved Into his mother’s taste All she wanted all she wanted was to spread her infection He spins her spindle weaving fuse Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend Her broken flesh They’ve stolen all my love Buried in absentia rose Can you hear my vitreous heart Breaking in absentia rose Smokestacks burn Eidolon turns I won’t ever let you go They’ve stolen all my love Yes they’ve stolen all my love He brings her the bait She makes him her pet Does he want some Does he want a little insurrection With oneiric gaze In somatic days Ocular incision Tell me I'm the reason I’ve just gotta get out of here He spins her spindle weaving fuse Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend Her useless flesh They’ve stolen all my love Buried in absentia rose Can you hear my vitreous heart Breaking in absentia rose Smokestacks burn Eidolon turns I won’t ever let you go They’ve stolen all my love Yes they’ve stolen all my love Taken by the night Divagate remembrance Check the puzzle does it fit I am alpha and omega And on the seventh day I rise Past the pangs of my resistance When the son gives up his throne What becomes of this theft Dasehra make these shackles go away Dasehra make these shackles go away Dasehra won’t you help me stand my ground if I should fall Dasehra as long as I am injured Dasehra as long as I remember Dasehra as long as I am injured Dasehra as long as I remember My anguish told you A persistent lie The parasitic psychics that you push by wheel Were spoken to me everytime And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought My torment adores you When my strings are tied Out of compulsion I must decimate The sapless embryonic miles And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought My knives are burrowed voices Glistened by the handles so they won't let go These limbs are out of reaches Extensions of a spirit that is not controlled My heart is trapped inside And I refuse to accept this throne My night's unfolding Reads like a page of test results This sterile codex Is missing all my last resolve And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought For all this burn it never hurt Shanks around the bend When you're foaming at the binge On your serrated edge you're like a snail that steps The hiss I make is warning to the scoundrels When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When nobody wants to fix this frame The guilty presence starts to vellicate Fall into the strangle skip around the neck This albatross is warning with extreme prejudice When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny Half of the time I'm never clean Filth of my filth can't get no relief Half of the time I see the weak Don't roll your eyes If still you can't see All of my coins Have been taken again They fill your void and still you're empty What's that set of numbers doing Count my fingers till extinction By the landfill I rest I burn their clothing before I dig into the ground I am Janus faced denial with vines you'll wish you hadn't run Clarity is calling me I hear the hums of tiny beating drums I feigned umbrage at my bruising fist you'll wish you hadn't run And with these trinkets pale of moon senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles when I nurse your tired heart And every time you hear the screams of lullabies collapsing walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling Their gourds are punctured easily amnesia fumes in little twists of silk induce this multistrobe with melody you'll wish you hadn't run I sing here at the seedy urn my father taught me when I was young you wear the tattered fringe of hangnail regalia you'll wish you hadn't run And with these trinkets pale of moon senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles when I nurse your tired heart And every time you hear the scream of lullabies collapsing walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling Here it comes again Mesh of arms travels up my neck Morning dawn declares itself And mirrors stare back at my reflection When I’m alone I’m alone at night I want winter to fall on me And I’m alone I’m alone in flight I am free of equity Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that I’m under A kindred connivance I’m ripped and in ruins Here it comes again Malady of Veda in your ears Flood the droughts that those I can’t stop myself because When I'm alone I’m alone at night I will set my father free And I’m alone I’m alone in flight My mother holds the lock and key Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over A kindred connivance I’m ripped and in ruins Long way patience to drown With friends that you won’t save for me Long way patience to drown Spin through my spiral I danced with delay Long way patience to drown You call me I answer and all I can do is obey Long way patience to drown I can’t hold my breath for this long When I’m alone I’m alone at night I wanna set my father free And I’m alone I’m alone in flight My mother holds the lock and key Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over I won’t let you I won’t let them Set me to repeat Make my bed in droughts of beryl I haven't shot this thing in years Do you think I'll fold Calloused hands of detriment From a crossbow flinch of gasping air Do you think I'll So long don't fall apart The words have made a perfect burden Sewn along your hollow heart We'll never hassle you Remember at the hips where we once joined Severed by the scalpel when we were young Do you think I'll fold Held under the water in a blacklist trough Buried in the plots of your front steps Do you think I'll fold Incinerate the faith that you were taught Incinerate your crown of useless flesh Do you think I'll So long don't fall apart The words have made a perfect burden Sewn along your hollow heart We'll never hassle you And if this life belonged to me you can stop the rain from falling Tie it on in your mind Its your noctourniquet And in your fight to live and breathe Then you keep it to the night Tie it on in your mind Its your noctourniquet Made my bed in droughts of beryl I haven't shot this thing in years Do you think I'll fold Your color seems to flower from your hissing tongue Your livery of siblings cut from saffron cloth Do you think I'll fold I'll reach out through the pavement with the shortest straw Lavera don't play in your mother's drawer Do you think I'll fold Come hasten to the first drop of endless flasks Heretics and peasants with a quench forboding Do you think I'll So long don't fall apart The words have made a perfect burden Sewn along your hollow heart We'll never hassle you So long don't fall apart The words have made a perfect burden Sewn along your hollow heart Whatever one takes whatever one takes for you I'm not breathing any better Mallets crack with every grin I hear the scraping plea of branches Against my broken window I won't let you in The silhouette holds me under Can't poke me with these pins Flotsam drip of nectar Nexus bean sprouting When she says Saint Christopher Don't go wandering With noone left to save Cause noone's at the wheel Saint Christopher Antidote claps with thunder From a gash of staple rain This bed will never rest you The answers in the sermons I won't let you in The stoking fits the crowning A wasted gust of kin Repulsion turns to nectar When the pigment leaves the body When she says Saint Christopher Don't go wandering With noone left to save Cause noone's at the wheel Saint Christopher Lastborn prey and firstborn caught Crawling like an animal Hold your breath its feeding time In this zed and two naughts Painted a fulcrum of caves Piled with dreams of Phantom masses made of pastures Labyrinths turning cystic maze I've been hanging wreaths of cancer On every door where children sing Watch it all blister Saint Christopher Don't go wandering With noone left to save Cause noone's at the wheel Saint Christopher Tell everyone now today I shall sing beautifully for my friends' pleasure We shall enjoy it As for him who finds fault may silliness and sorrow take him Standing by my bed In gold sandals Dawn that very moment awoke me I asked myself What Sappho can you give one who has everything like Aphrodite And I said I shall burn the fat thigh bones of a white she goat on her altar I confess I love that which caresses me I believe Love has his share in the Sun's brilliance and virtue At noontime when the earth is bright with flaming heat falling straight down the cricket sets up a high pictched singing in his wings I took my lyre and said: come now my heavenly tortoise shell: become a speaking instrument Although they are only breath words which I command are immortal That afternoon girls ripe to marry wove flower heads into necklaces We heard them chanting: Young Adonis is dying O Cytherea What shall we do now Batter your breasts with your fists girls tatter your dresses It's no use Mother dear I can't finish my weaving You may blame Aphrodite soft as she is she has almost killed me with love for that boy People do gossip And they say about Leda that she once found an egg hidden under wild hyacinths Peace reigned in heaven Ambrosia stood already mixed in the wine bowl It was Hermes who took up the wine jug and poured wine for the gods When I saw Eros On his way down from heaven he wore a soldier's cloak dyed purple You are the herdsman of evening Hesperus you herd homeward whatever Dawn's light dispersed You herd sheep herd goats herd children home to their mothers Sleep darling I have a small daughter called Cleis who is like a golden flower I wouldn't take all Croesus' kingdom with love thrown in for her Although clumsy Mnasidica has a more shapely figure than our gentle Gyrinno Tomorrow you had better use your soft hands Dica to tear off dill shoots to cap your lovely curls She who wears flowers attracts the happy Graces: they turn back from a bare head We put the urn aboard ship with this inscription: This is the dust of little Timas who unmarried was led into Persephone's dark bedroom And she being far from home girls her age took new edged blades to cut in mourning for her these curls of their soft hair Cyprian in my dream The folds of a purple kercheif shadowed your cheeks the one Timas one time sent a timid gift all the way from Phocaea In the spring twilight The full moon is shining: Girls take their places as though around an altar And their feet move Rhythmically as tender feet of Cretan girls danced once around an altar of love crushing a cirlce in the soft smooth flowering grass Awed by her splendor stars near the lovely moon cover their own bright faces when she is roundest and lights earth with her silver Now while we dance Come here to us gentle Gaiety Revelry Radiance and you Muses with lovely hair the evening star is the most beautiful of all stars it is time now For you who are so pretty and charming to share in games that the pink ankled Graces play and gold Aphrodite O never I shall be a virgin always For her sake we ask you to come now O Graces O rosy armed perfection: God's daughters They're locked in oh The doorkeeper's feet are twelve yards long ten shoemakers used five oxhides to cobble sandals for them Like a quince apple ripening on a top brance in a tree top not once noticed by harvesters or if not unnoticed not reached Like a hyacinth in the mountains trampled by shepherds until on a purple stain remains on the ground You wear her livery shining with gold you too Hecate Queen of Night hand maid to Aphrodite Why am I crying Am I still sad because of my lost maidenhead You know the place: then Leave Crete and come to us waiting where the grove is pleasantest by precincts sacred to you: incense smokes on the altar cold streams murmur through the apple branches a young rose thicket shades the ground and quivering leaves pour down deep sleep; in meadows where horses have grown sleek among spring flowers dill scents the air Queen Cyprian Fill our gold cups with love stirred into clear nectar Without warning as a whirlwind swoops on an oak love shakes my heart If you will come I shall put out new pillows for you to rest on I was so happy Believe me I prayed that that night might be doubled for us Now I know why Eros Of all the progeny of Earth and Heaven has been most dearly loved She was dressed well: Her feet were hidden under embroidered sandal straps fine handwork from Asia With his venom irresistable and bittersweet that loosener of limbs Love reptile like strikes me down Afraid of losing you I ran fluttering like a little girl after her mother It is clear now: neither honey nor the honey bee is to be mine again Day day out I hunger and I struggle You will say See I have come back to the soft arms I turned from in the old days Tell me out of all mankind whom do you love Better than you love me You may forget but let me tell you this: someone in some future time will think of us pain penetrates me drop by drop The nightingale's The soft spoken announcer of Spring's presence Last night I dreamed that you and I had words: Cyprian Tonight I've watched the moon and then the Pleiades go down The night is now half gone; youth goes; I am in bed alone Persuasion Aprodite's daughter you cheat mortals Many's the time I've wished I O gold crowned Aphrodite had luck like that That was different My girlhood then was in full bloom and you This way that way I do not know what to do: I am of two minds If you are squeamish don't prod the beach rubble We know this much Death is an evil; we have the gods' word for it; they too would die if death were a good thing Do you remember How a golden broom grows on the sea beaches You remind me of a very gentle little girl I once watched picking flowers When they were tired Night rained her thick dark sleep upon their eyes The gods bless you May you sleep then on some tender girl friend's breast Cat's foot iron claw Neuro surgeons scream for more At paranoia's poison door Twenty first century schizoid man Blood rack barbed wire Politicians' funeral pyre Innocents raped with napalm fire Twenty first century schizoid man Death seed blind man's greed Poets' starving children bleed Nothing he's got he really needs Twenty first century schizoid man Said the straight man to the late man Where have you been I've been here and I've been there And I've been in between I talk to the wind My words are all carried away I talk to the wind The wind does not hear The wind cannot hear I'm on the outside looking inside What do I see Much confusion disillusion All around me I talk to the wind My words are all carried away I talk to the wind The wind does not hear The wind cannot hear You don't possess me Don't impress me Just upset my mind Can't instruct me or conduct me Just use up my time I talk to the wind My words are all carried away I talk to the wind The wind does not hear The wind cannot hear I talk to the wind My words are all carried away I talk to the wind The wind does not hear The wind cannot hear The wind does not hear The wind cannot hear The wall on which the prophets wrote Is cracking at the seams Upon the instruments of death The sunlight brightly gleams When every man is torn apart With nightmares and with dreams Will no one lay the laurel wreath When silence drowns the screams Confusion will be my epitaph As I crawl a cracked and broken path If we make it we can all sit back and laugh But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Between the iron gates of fate The seeds of time were sown And watered by the deeds of those Who know and who are known Knowledge is a deadly friend If no one sets the rules The fate of all mankind I see Is in the hands of fools The wall on which the prophets wrote Is cracking at the seams Upon the instruments of death The sunlight brightly gleams When every man is torn apart With nightmares and with dreams Will no one lay the laurel wreath When silence drowns the screams Confusion will be my epitaph As I crawl a cracked and broken path If we make it we can all sit back and laugh But I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Crying.. Crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Yes I fear tomorrow I'll be crying Crying Call her moonchild Dancing in the shallows of a river Lonely moonchild Dreaming in the shadows of the willow Talking to the trees of the cobweb strange Sleeping on the steps of a fountain Waving silver wands to the night birds song Waiting for the sun on the mountain She's a moonchild Gathering the flowers in a garden Lovely moonchild Drifting on the echoes of the hours Sailing on the wind in a milk white gown Dropping circle stones on a sun dial Playing hide and seek with the ghosts of dawn Waiting for a smile from a sun child The rusted chains of prison moons Are shattered by the sun I walk a road horizons change The tournament's begun The purple piper plays his tune The choir softly sing Three lullabies in an ancient tongue For the court of the crimson king The keeper of the city keys Put shutters on the dreams I wait outside the pilgrim's door With insufficient schemes The black queen chants the funeral march The cracked brass bells will ring To summon back the fire witch To the court of the crimson king The gardener plants an evergreen Whilst trampling on a flower I chase the wind of a prism ship To taste the sweet and sour The pattern juggler lifts his hand The orchestra begin As slowly turns the grinding wheel In the court of the crimson king On soft gray mornings widows cry The wise men share a joke I run to grasp divining signs To satisfy the hoax The yellow jester does not play But gently pulls the strings And smiles as the puppets dance In the court of the crimson king And I had a dream About my old school And she was there all pink and gold and glittering I threw my arms around her legs Came to weeping (came to weeping Came to weeping (came to weeping And I heard your voice As clear as day And you told me I should concentrate It was all so strange And so surreal That a ghost should be so practical Only if for a night And the only solution was to stand and fight And my body was bruised and I was set alight But you came over me like some holy rite And although I was burning you're the only light Only if for a night And the grass was so green against my new clothes And I did cartwheels in your honour Dancing on tiptoes My own secret ceremonials Before the service began In the graveyard doing handstands And I heard your voice As clear as day And you told me I should concentrate It was all so strange And so surreal That a ghost should be so practical Only if for a night And the only solution was to stand and fight And my body was bruised and I was set alight But you came over me like some holy rite And although I was burning you're the only light Only if for a night Madam my dear my darling Tell me what all the sighing's about Tell me what all the sighing's about And I heard your voice As clear as day And you told me I should concentrate It was all so strange And so surreal That a ghost should be so practical Only if for a night Only if for a night Regrets collect like old friends Here to relive your darkest moments I can see no way I can see no way And all of the ghouls come out to play And every demon wants his pound of flesh But I like to keep some things to myself I like to keep my issues drawn It's always darkest before the dawn And I've been a fool and I've been blind I can never leave the past behind I can see no way I can see no way I'm always dragging that horse around All of his questions such a mournful sound Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground So I like to keep my issues drawn But it's always darkest before the dawn Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off oh whoa And I am done with my graceless heart So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart 'Cause I like to keep my issues drawn It's always darkest before the dawn Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off oh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back And given half the chance would I take any of it back It's a fine romance but it's left me so undone It's always darkest before the dawn Oh whoa oh whoa And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat 'Cause looking for heaven found the devil in me Looking for heaven found the devil in me Well what the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me yeah Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off oh whoa Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa Shake it out shake it out shake it out shake it out ooh whoa And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back So shake him off oh whoa Time it took us To where the water was That’s what the water gave me And time goes quicker Between the two of us Oh my love don’t forsake me Take what the water gave me Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow And oh poor Atlas The world’s a beast of a burden You’ve been holding up a long time And all this longing And the ships are left to rust That’s what the water gave us So lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow ‘Cause they took your loved ones But returned them in exchange for you But would you have it any other way Would you have it any other way You couldn't have it any other way ‘Cause she’s a cruel mistress And a bargain must be made But oh my love don’t forget me When I let the water take me So lay me down Let the only sound Be the over flow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow So lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Pockets full of stones Lay me down Let the only sound Be the overflow Looking up from underneath Fractured moonlight on the sea Reflections still look the same to me As before I went under And it's peaceful in the deep Cathedral where you cannot breathe No need to pray no need to speak Now I am under all And it's breaking over me A thousand miles down to the sea bed Found the place to rest my head Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go And the arms of the ocean are carrying me And all this devotion was rushing out of me And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me But the arms of the ocean delivered me Though the pressure's hard to take It's the only way I can escape It seems a heavy choice to make And now I am under all And it's breaking over me A thousand miles down to the sea bed Found the place to rest my head Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go And the arms of the ocean are carrying me And all this devotion was rushing out of me And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me But the arms of the ocean delivered me And it's over And I'm going under But I'm not giving up I'm just giving in I'm slipping underneath So cold and so sweet And the arms of the ocean so sweet and so cold And all this devotion I never knew at all And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released And the arms of the ocean delivered me Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Deliver me Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Deliver me Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Deliver me Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go Never let me go And it's over (Never let me go Never let me go And I'm going under (Never let me go Never let me go But I'm not giving up (Never let me go Never let me go I'm just giving in (Never let me go Never let me go I'm slipping underneath (Never let me go Never let me go So cold and so sweet (Never let me go Never let me go All alone It was always there you see And even on my own It was always standing next to me I can see it coming from the edge of the room Creeping in the streetlight Holding my hand in the pale gloom Can you see it coming now Oh I think I'm breaking down again Oh I think I'm breaking down All alone Even when I was a child I've always known There was something to be frightened of You know that I can see you coming from the edge of the room Creeping in the streetlight Holding my hand in the pale gloom Can you see it coming now Oh I think I'm breaking down again Oh I think I'm breaking down All alone On the edge of sleep My old familiar friend Comes and lies down next to me And I can see you coming from the edge of the room Smiling in the streetlight Even with my eyes shut tight I

river oh the river it’s running free And oh the joy oh the joy it brings to me But I know it’ll have to drown me Before I can breathe easy And I’ve seen it in the flights of birds I’ve seen it in you The entrails of the animals The blood running through But in order to get to the heart I think sometimes you'll have to cut through But you can’t… We will carry… We will carry you there… Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Keep it up I know you can Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Cause I am… On the sea on the sea and land over land Creeping and crawling like the sea over sand Still I follow heartlines on your hand And there’s fantasy there’s fallacy there’s tumbling stone Echoes of a city that’s long overgrown Your heart is the only place that I call home I cannot be returned You can… You can… I know you can… Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Keep it up I know you can Just keep following The heartlines on your hand What a thing to do… Oooh What a thing to choose… But know in some way I’m there with you Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Keep it up I know you can Just keep following The heartlines on your hand Cause I am When we first came here We were cold and we were clear With no colors in our skin We were light and paper thin And when we first came here we were cold and we were clear With no colors in our skin 'Til we let the spectrum in Say my name And every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again And when we come for you We'll be dressed up all in blue With the ocean in our arms Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms And when it's time to pray We'll be dressed up all in grey With metal on our tongues And silver in our lungs Say my name And every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again And when we come back we'll be dressed in black And you'll scream my name aloud And we won't eat and we won't sleep We'll drag bodies from a ground So say my name And every color illuminates And we are shining And we'll never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name As every color illuminates We are shining And we will never be afraid again Say my name We are shining Say my name Say my name And we will never be afraid again And the heart is hard to translate It has a language of its own It talks in tongues and quiet sighs And prayers and proclamations In the grand days of great men and the smallest of gestures And short shallow gasps But with all my education I can’t seem to command it And the words are all escaping and coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how I can’t seem to understand it And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see ‘Cause I’ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all And it talks to me in tiptoes And it sings to me inside It cries out in the darkest night and breaks in the morning light But with all my education I can’t seem to command it And the words are all escaping and coming back all damaged And I would put them back in poetry if I only knew how I can’t seem to understand it And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see ‘Cause I’ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all And I would give all this and heaven too I would give it all if only for a moment That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see ‘Cause I’ve been scrawling it forever but it never makes sense to me at all No words are a language It doesn’t deserve such treatment And all of my stumbling phrases never amounted to anything worth this feeling All this heaven never could describe such a feeling as I'm hearing Words were never so useful So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before I'm gonna be released from behind these lines And I don't care whether I live or die And I'm losing blood I'm gonna leave my bones And I don't want your heart it leaves me cold I don't want your future I don't need your past One bright moment Is all I ask I'm gonna leave my body (moving up to higher ground I'm gonna lose my mind (History keeps pulling me down Said I'm

How long must I wait How long must I wait Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused The avulsion whims its spurs in the pinches of my earth The dust I kick of animus shatters Recorded on my reels of tape the trauma stops my flow and in your suppression tastes sulfur Hear the children say (Inexpressible innocence How long must I wait How long must I wait Til the mountains of avarice turn blue How long must I wait How long must I wait Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused As suddenly your avalanche reverses my polarity And secretly come Sunday morning standing at the pulpit to an empty room Hear the children say (Inexpressible innocence Tear of mended sails How long must I wait How long must I wait Til the mountains of avarice turn blue How long must I wait How long must I wait Til the moleskin I pick becomes fused The drowning water you drink passed on by birth I’m no longer willing to give you control There was once a boy With knives stuck in his voice All he wanted all he wanted was a little affection Until one day he came To tempt his mother’s taste All she wanted all she wanted was to spread her infection Spit and spindle we refuse Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend Her broken thoughts They’ve stolen all my love Buried in absentia Can you hear my vitreous heart Breaking in absentia Smokestacks burn I won’t turn I won’t ever let you go They’ve stolen all my love Yes they’ve stolen all my love He returns alone Changes here nor there Does he want some Does he want a little insurrection Withhold my regrets Insomnatic fate Opt out of incision Tear down the reason I’ve just gotta get out of here Spit and spindle we refuse Burning fumes of lucid youth to mend Her restless limbs They’ve stolen all my love Buried in absentia Can you hear my vitreous heart Breaking in absentia Smokestacks burn I won’t turn I won’t ever let you go They’ve stolen all my love Yes they’ve stolen all my love Taken by the night Dye the gates remembrance Check the puzzle does it fit I am alpha and omega And on the seventh day I rise Past the pangs of my resistance When the son gives up his throne What becomes of this theft Dasehra make these shackles go away Dasehra make these shackles go away Dasehra won’t you help me stand my ground if I should fall Dasehra as long as I am injured Dasehra as long as I remember Dasehra as long as I am injured Dasehra as long as I remember My anguish told you A persistent lie The parasitic psychics that you push by wheel Were spoken to me everytime And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought My torment adores you When my strings are tied Out of compulsion I must decimate The sapless embryonic miles And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought My knives are burrowed voices Glistened by the handles so they won't let go These limbs are out of reaches Extensions of a spirit that is not controlled My heart is trapped inside And I refuse to accept this throne My night's unfolding Reads like a page of test results This sterile codex Is missing all my last resolve And like a charlatan You counterfeit the vessels through flesh and time These pacts we keep in secret Drinking from a well that was cured by drought The world is burned it never hurts shanks round the bend when you're foaming at the binge On your serrated edge you're like a snail that sticks The hiss I make is warning to the scoundrel When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When the body wants to fix this frame the guilty presence starts to villicate Fall into the strangle skip around the neck this albatross is warning with extreme prejudice When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny When you walk the plank tell me what you see Moloch in the time of mutiny Half of the time I'm never clean Filth of my filth can't get no relief Half of the time I see the weak Don't roll your eyes and still you can't see All of my coins you've taken and gave Filled 'til you're bawling and still you're empty What's that satchel of numbers doing Can't my fingers tell extinction By the landfill I rest I burn their clothing before I dig into the ground I am Janus faced denial with vines you're gonna wish you hadn't run Clarity is calling me I hear the hums of tiny beating drums I feigned umbrage at my bruising fist you're gonna wish you hadn't run And with these trinkets pale of moon senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles when I nurse your tired heart For every time you hear the strain of lullabies collapsing walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling Their gourds are punctured easily amnesia fumes in little twists of silk induce this multistrobe with melody you're gonna wish you hadn't run I sing here at the seedy urn my father taught me when I was young you wear the tattered fringe of hangnail regalia you're gonna wish you hadn't run And with these trinkets pale of moon senescent charms become a bludgeon of wrinkles when I nurse your tired heart For every time you hear the strain of lullabies collapsing walk towards the echo and let it hold you trembling Here it comes again Mesh of arms travels up my neck Morning dawn declares itself And mirrors stare back at my reflection When I’m alone I’m alone at night I want winter to fall on me And I’m alone I’m alone in flight I am free of equity Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion that I’m under A kindred connivance I’m ripped and in ruins Here it comes again Malady of Veda in your ears Flood the droughts that those I can’t stop myself because When I'm alone I’m alone at night I will set my father free And I’m alone I’m alone in flight My mother holds the lock and key Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over A kindred connivance I’m ripped and in ruins Long way patience to drown With friends that you won’t save for me Long way patience to drown Spin through my spiral I danced with delay Long way patience to drown You call me I answer and all I can do is obey Long way patience to drown I can’t hold my breath for this long When I’m alone I’m alone at night I wanna set my father free And I’m alone I’m alone in flight My mother holds the lock and key Where did I go wrong I’ve got a sneaking suspicion it ain’t over I won’t let you I won’t let them Set me to repeat I'm not breathing any better Mallets crack with every grin I hear the scraping plea of branches Against my broken window I won't let you in The silhouette holds me under Can't poke me with these pins Flotsam drip of nectar Nexus bean sprouting When she says Saint Christopher Don't go wandering With noone left to save Cause noone's at the wheel Saint Christopher Antidote claps with thunder From a gash of staple rain This bed will never rest

night She tells me I'm not capable of what they accuse me With no remorse I stand and say that guilt is what I plead My devil makes me dream like no other mortal dreams With a blank eye corner The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept By the longest tusk of corridors numb below the neck In my heart Where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters When I bend and kick in form with twilight as my guide In every home the ghost pays gossip you can hear them if you try When my quill begins to squirm from the ashes in your urn Your deviance is anything but faithful My devil makes me dream like no other mortal dreams With a blank eye corner The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept By the longest tusk of corridors numb below the neck In my heart Where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters Everybody in my dead leaves Don't you hide these branches waiting I've been watching you four two me Don't resign me I'm not waiting My devil makes me dream like no other mortal dreams With a blank eye corner The only way to see him in the tunnel where he slept By the longest tusk of corridors numb below the neck In my heart Where he keeps them in a vault of devil daughters When sanskrit was my mother tongue Scarabs filled my pillow Tarmac strips to pave for them And thrones from which to teach And in that pulse the future said The story had been spun You wet your bed so sleep in it Cards can't make a house And up that hill go the last of my crumbs We'll be lucky if we eat tonight And up that hill go the last of my crumbs That's why I'll magnify a hole When light years came And light years passed Tugging on the brink Spoils reported missing Put down in its sleep Strangled in the background Fitted for a mask The future won't believe you Past the ransom fast And up that hill go the last of my crumbs We'll be lucky if we eat tonight And up that hill go the last of my crumbs That's why I'll magnify a hole Don't beat around the pulpit There is no lost and found Where is the devil waiting Trying to disguise I've seen what you used to look like But down here you won't survive I've got the weight of half of the world Don't stop dragging the lake I won't come home If you can't come home Even if you make a grave with my name You better keep on looking for me With qualms that I speak of the wrists I have cut By flooding the tubs where the warmth held below The lockets believe that the secret of love Has caught its own tail and it just won't give up When I breathe the heavens can't hold me And I can't believe anymore The light breathes the highest execution Show me the wings I must cut In your left of days these are desperate graves Give me the alter let me shine The pendulum won't wait If I slay your spirits with twin covent vaults That weakened your knees in the pit of my palms Dressed in the slurs of bovine engines To feast upon the carcass of your mother When I breathe the heavens can't hold me And I can't believe anymore The light breathes the highest execution Show me the wings I must cut In your left of days these are desperate graves Give me the alter let me shine The pendulum won't wait When I turn the dial and leave the gas on I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose These are the splinters made from a single blade I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose I'm like the key that locks you in I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose When you wear the burning of all my ferns I'm the matchstick that you'll never lose In your left of days these are desperate graves Give me the alter let me shine The pendulum won't wait How much do you make in that death factory Severance hold in the chamber of revolvers Empty jails fall from my scalp shaped the glove and let me out Still I can remember the day that they took you from me Seems like I've been running from your trenchant memory Harpsichord will warn me when its over Cause if heaven breathes then someone trade places with me Cause I don't want to tar feathers instead of rags Instead of rags When do I get to see the body preserved inside this brim sewn on the lips were her last words I'll be damned I can still hear her laughing Your angels have tangled their breasts again (lol the comfort of doubt still it keeps you thin And still I can remember the day that they took you from me Seems like I've been running from your trenchant memory Harpsichord will warn me when its over Cause if heaven breathes then someone trade places with me Cause I don't want to tar feathers instead of rags Instead of rags Does your temperature ache Is your glass about to break Are you purple with currant Will you now become the serpent Gordian knots in the powerlines sizes fill empty with pesticide With a pharaoh to hold bury me in gold Will your sun refuse to bite in the Stockholm city that we provide If your heart does cease to speak my fingernail claw will make your chalkboard sing Bear me to Dictaeus and to the steep slopes; to the river Erymanthus I choose spray of dittany cyperum frail of flower buds of myrrh all healing herbs close pressed in calathes For she lies panting drawing sharp breath broken with harsh sobs she Hyella whom no god pities Dryads haunting the groves nereids who dwell in wet caves for all the white leaves of olive branch and early roses and ivy wreaths woven gold berries which she once brought to your altars bear now ripe fruits from Arcadia and Assyrian wine to shatter her fever The light of her face falls from its flower as a hyacinth hidden in a far valley perishes upon burnt grass Pales bring gifts bring your Phoenician stuffs and do you fleet footed nymphs bring offerings Illyrian iris and a branch of shrub and frail headed poppies The hard sand breaks And the grains of it Are clear as wine Far off over the leagues of it The wind Playing on the wide shore Piles little ridges And the great waves Break over it But more than the many foamed ways Of the sea I know him Of the triple path ways Hermes Who awaiteth Dubious Facing three ways Welcoming wayfarers He whom the sea orchard Shelters from the west From the east Weathers sea wind; Fronts the great dunes Wind rushes Over the dunes And the coarse salt crusted grass Answers Heu It whips round my ankles Small is This white stream Flowing below ground From the poplar shaded hill But the water is sweet Apples on the small trees Are hard Too small Too late ripened By a desperate sun That struggles through sea mist The boughs of the trees Are twisted By many bafflings; Twisted are The small leafed boughs But the shadow of them Is not the shadow of the mast head Nor of the torn sails Hermes Hermes The great sea foamed Gnashed its teeth about me; But you have waited Where sea grass tangles with Shore grass I saw the first pear as it fell the honey seeking golden banded the yellow swarm was not more fleet than I (spare us from loveliness and I fell prostrate crying: you have flayed us with your blossoms spare us the beauty of fruit trees The honey seeking paused not the air thundered their song and I alone was prostrate O rough hewn god of the orchard I bring you an offering do you alone unbeautiful son of the god spare us from loveliness: these fallen hazel nuts stripped late of their green sheaths grapes red purple their berries dripping with wine pomegranates already broken and shrunken figs and quinces untouched I bring you as offering Weed moss weed root tangled in sand sea iris brittle flower one petal like a shell is broken and you print a shadow like a thin twig Fortunate one scented and stinging rigid myrrh bud camphor flower sweet and salt you are wind in our nostrils Do the murex fishers drench you as they pass Do your roots drag up colour from the sand Have they slipped gold under you rivets of gold Band of iris flowers above the waves you are painted blue painted like a fresh prow stained among the salt weeds You are clear O rose cut in rock hard as the descent of hail I could scrape the colour from the petals like spilt dye from a rock If I could break you I could break a tree If I could stir I could break a tree I could break you O wind rend open the heat cut apart the heat rend it to tatters Fruit cannot drop through this thick air fruit cannot fall into heat that presses up and blunts the points of pears and rounds the grapes Cut the heat plough through it turning it on either side of your path The night has cut each from each and curled the petals back from the stalk and under it in crisp rows; under at an unfaltering pace under till the rinds break back till each bent leaf is parted from its stalk; under at a grave pace under till the leaves are bent back till they drop upon earth back till they are all broken O night you take the petals of the roses in your hand but leave the stark core of the rose to perish on the branch Instead of pearls a wrought clasp a bracelet will you accept this You know the script you will start wonder: what is left what phrase after last night This: The world is yet unspoiled for you you wait expectant you are like the children who haunt your own steps for chance bits a comb that may have slipped a gold tassel unravelled plucked from your scarf twirled by your slight fingers into the street a flower dropped Do not think me unaware I who have snatched at you as the street child clutched at the seed pearls you spilt that hot day when your necklace snapped Do not dream that I speak as one defrauded of delight sick shaken by each heart beat or paralyzed stretched at length who gasps: these ripe pears are bitter to the taste this spiced wine poison corrupt I cannot walk who would walk Life is a scavenger’s pit I escape I only rejecting it lying here on this couch Your garden sloped to the beach myrtle overran the paths honey and amber flecked each leaf the citron lily head one among many weighed there over sweet The myrrh hyacinth spread across low slopes violets streaked black ridges through the grass The house too was like this over painted over lovely the world is like this Sleepless nights I remember the initiates their gesture their calm glance I have heard how in rapt thought in vision they speak with another race more beautiful more intense than this I could laugh more beautiful more intense Perhaps that other life is contrast always to this I reason: I have lived as they in their inmost rites they endure the tense nerves through the moment of ritual I endure from moment to moment days pass all alike tortured intense This I forgot last night: you must not be blamed it is not your fault; as a child a flower any flower tore my breast meadow chicory a common grass tip a leaf shadow a flower tint unexpected on a winter branch I reason: another life holds what this lacks a sea unmoving quiet not forcing our strength to rise to it beat on beat stretch of sand no garden beyond strangling with its myrrh lilies a hill not set with black violets but stones stones bare rocks dwarf trees twisted no beauty to distract to crowd madness upon madness Only a still place and perhaps some outer horror some hideousness to stamp beauty a mark no changing it now on our hearts I send no string of pearls no bracelet accept this Men fires feasts steps of temple fore stone lintel step of white altar fire and after fire slaughter before fragment of burnt meat deep mystery grapple of mind to reach the tense thought power and wealth purpose and prayer alike (men fires feasts temple steps useless Useless to me who plant wide feet on a mighty plinth useless to me who sit wide of shoulder great of thigh heavy in gold to press gold back against solid back of the marble seat: useless the dragons wrought on the arms useless the poppy buds and the gold inset of the spray of wheat Ah they have wrought me heavy and great of limb she is slender of waist slight of breast made of many fashions; they have set her small feet on many a plinth; she they have known she they have spoken with she they have smiled upon she they have caught and flattered with praise and gifts But useless the flattery of the mighty power they have granted me: for I will not stay in her breast the great of limb though perfect the shell they have fashioned me these men Do I sit in the market place do I smile does a noble brow bend like the brow of Zeus am I a spouse his or any am I a woman or goddess or queen to be met by a god with a smile and left Do you ask for a scroll parchment oracle prophecy precedent; do you ask for tablets marked with thought or words cut deep on the marble surface do you seek measured utterance or the mystic trance Sleep on the stones of Delphi dare the ledges of Pallas but keep me foremost keep me before you after you with you never forget when you start for the Delphic precipice never forget when you seek Pallas and meet in thought yourself drawn out from yourself like the holy serpent never forget in thought or mysterious trance I am greatest and least Soft are the hands of Love soft soft are his feet; you who have twined myrtle have you brought crocuses white as the inner stript bark of the osier have you set black crocus against the black locks of another Of whom do I speak Many the children of gods but first I take Bromios fostering prince lift from the ivy brake a king Enough of the lightning enough of the tales that speak of the death of the mother: strange tales of a shelter brought to the unborn enough of tale myth mystery precedent a child lay on the earth asleep Soft are the hands of Love but what soft hands clutched at the thorny ground scratched like a small white ferret or foraging whippet or hound sought nourishment and found only the crackling of ivy dead ivy leaf and the white berry food for a bird no food for this who sought bending small head in a fever whining with little breath Ah small black head ah the purple ivy bush ah berries that shook and spilt on the form beneath who begot you and left Though I begot no man child all my days the child of my heart and spirit is the child the gods desert alike and the mother in death the unclaimed Dionysios IV What of her mistress of Death Form of a golden wreath were my hands that girt her head fingers that strove to meet and met where the whisps escaped from the fillet of tenderest gold small circlet and slim were my fingers then Now they are wrought of iron to wrest from earth secrets; strong to protect strong to keep back the winter when winter tracks too soon blanch the forest: strong to break dead things the young tree drained of sap the old tree ready to drop to lift from the rotting bed of leaves the old crumbling pine tree stock to heap bole and knot of fir and pine and resinous oak till fire shatter the dark and hope of spring rise in the hearts of men What of her mistress of Death what of his kiss Ah strong were his arms to wrest slight limbs from the beautiful earth young hands that plucked the first buds of the chill narcissus soft fingers that broke and fastened the thorny stalk with the flower of wild acanthus Ah strong were the arms that took (ah evil the heart and graceless but the kiss was less passionate Great bright portal shelf of rock rocks fitted in long ledges rocks fitted to dark to silver granite to lighter rock clean cut white against white High high and no hill goat tramples no mountain sheep has set foot on your fine grass; you lift you are the world edge pillar for the sky arch The world heaved we are next to the sky: over us sea hawks shout gulls sweep past the terrible breakers are silent from this place Below us on the rock edge where earth is caught in the fissures of the jagged cliff a small tree stiffens in the gale it bends but its white flowers are fragrant at this height And under and under the wind booms: it whistles it thunders it growls it presses the grass beneath its great feet I said: for ever and for ever must I follow you through the stones I catch at you you lurch: you are quicker than my hand grasp I wondered at you I shouted dear mysterious beautiful white myrtle flesh I was splintered and torn: the hill path mounted swifter than my feet Could a daemon avenge this hurt I would cry to him could a ghost I would shout O evil follow this god taunt him with his evil and his vice Shall I hurl myself from here shall I leap and be nearer you Shall I drop beloved beloved ankle against ankle Would you pity me O white breast If I woke would you pity me would our eyes meet Have you heard do you know how I climbed this rock My breath caught I lurched forward stumbled in the ground myrtle Have you heard O god seated on the cliff how far toward the ledges of your house how far I had to walk IV Over me the wind swirls I have stood on your portal and I know you are further than this still further on another cliff It is strange that I should want this sight of your face we have had so much: at any moment now I may pass stand near the gate do not speak only reach if you can your face half fronting the passage toward the light Fate God sends this as a mark a last token that we are not forgot lost in this turmoil about to be crushed out burned or stamped out at best with sudden death The spearsman who brings this will ask for the gold clasp you wear under your coat I gave all I had left Press close to the portal my gate will soon clang and your fellow wretches will crowd to the entrance be first at the gate Ah beloved do not speak I write this in great haste do not speak you may yet be released I am glad enough to depart though I have never tasted life as in these last weeks It is a strange life patterned in fire and letters on the prison pavement If I glance up it is written on the walls it is cut on the floor it is patterned across the slope of the roof I am weak weak last night if the guard had left the gate unlocked I could not have ventured to escape but one thought serves me now with strength As I pass down the corridor past desperate faces at each cell your eyes and my eyes may meet You will be dark unkempt but I pray for one glimpse of your face why do I want this I who have seen you at the banquet each flower of your hyacinth circlet white against your hair Why do I want this when even last night you startled me from sleep You stood against the dark rock you grasped an elder staff So many nights you have distracted me from terror Once you lifted a spear flower I remember how you stooped to gather it and it flamed the leaf and shoot and the threads yellow yellow sheer till they burnt to red purple in the cup As I pass your cell door do not speak I was first on the list They may forget you tried to shield me as the horsemen passed The sea called you faced the estuary you were drowned as the tide passed I am glad of this at least you have escaped The heavy sea mist stifles me I choke with each breath a curious peril this the gods have invented curious torture for us One of us pierced in the flank dragged himself across the marsh he tore at the bay roots lost hold on the crumbling bank Another crawled too late for shelter under the cliffs I am glad the tide swept you out O beloved you of all this ghastly host alone untouched your white flesh covered with salt as with myrrh and burnt iris We were hemmed in this place so few of us so few of us to fight their sure lances the straight thrust effortless with slight life of muscle and shoulder So straight only we were left the four of us somehow shut off And the marsh dragged one back and another perished under the cliff and the tide swept you out Your feet cut steel on the paths I followed for the strength of life and grasp I have seen beautiful feet but never beauty welded with strength I marvelled at your height You stood almost level with the lance bearers and so slight And I wondered as you clasped your shoulder strap at the strength of your wrist and the turn of your young fingers and the lift of your shorn locks and the bronze of your sun burnt neck All of this and the curious knee cap fitted above the wrought greaves and the sharp muscles of your back which the tunic could not cover the outline no garment could deface I wonder if you knew how I watched how I crowded before the spearsmen but the gods wanted you the gods wanted you back Drenched with purple drenched with dye my wool bind you the wheel spokes turn turn turn my wheel Drenched with purple steeped in the red pulp of bursting sea sloes turn turn turn my wheel (Ah did he think I did not know I did not feel what wrack what weal for him: golden one golden one turn again Aphrodite with the yellow zone I am cursed cursed undone Ah and my face Aphrodite beside your gold is cut out of white stone Laurel blossom and the red seed of the red vervain weed burn crackle in the fire burn crackle for my need Laurel leaf O fruited branch of bay burn burn away thought memory and hurt (Ah when he comes stumbling across my sill will he find me still fragrant as the white privet or as a bone polished in wet and sun worried of wild beaks and of the whelps’ teeth worried of flesh left to bleach under the sun white as ash bled of heat white as hail blazing in sheet lightning white as forked lightning rending the sleet They say there is no hope sand drift rocks rubble of the sea the broken hulk of a ship hung with shreds of rope pallid under the cracked pitch They say there is no hope to conjure you no whip of the tongue to anger you no hate of words you must rise to refute They say you are twisted by the sea you are cut apart by wave break upon wave break that you are misshapen by the sharp rocks broken by the rasp and after rasp That you are cut torn mangled torn by the stress and beat no stronger than the strips of sand along your ragged beach But we bring violets great masses single sweet wood violets stream violets violets from a wet marsh Violets in clumps from hills tufts with earth at the roots violets tugged from rocks blue violets moss cliff river violets Yellow violets’ gold burnt with a rare tint violets like red ash among tufts of grass We bring deep purple bird foot violets We bring the hyacinth violet sweet bare chill to the touch and violets whiter than the in rush of your own white surf For you will come you will yet haunt men in ships you will trail across the fringe of strait and circle the jagged rocks You will trail across the rocks and wash them with your salt you will curl between sand hills you will thunder along the cliff break retreat get fresh strength gather and pour weight upon the beach You will draw back and the ripple on the sand shelf will be witness of your track O privet white you will paint the lintel of wet sand with froth You will bring myrrh bark and drift laurel wood from hot coasts when you hurl high high we will answer with a shout For you will come you will come you will answer our taut hearts you will break the lie of men’s thoughts and cherish and shelter us Helen herself seems
