  It's not {noun}. A half-consumed bottle of {noun_2} fell on that side of the {noun_3} and {verb_past_tense}
  there for a few weeks. Then there was a string of {adjective} days, which evidently {verb_past_tense_2} up the
  {noun_4} in the bottle and the bottle {verb_past_tense_3} onto the wall. It's not a {noun_5}print, I guess from the
  picture it kind of looks to be in the shape of a {noun_5}print.

  When I was a youngster, I made the fatal mistake of telling a few {people} how much I enjoyed {name} the {animal}.
  Every holiday and birthday after that, I was inundated with {name} books, {plural_noun}, T-shirts, and stuffed
  {plural_noun_2}. I was positive {name} would eventually be etched onto my tombstone. My love for the {adjective},
  {food}-loving, Monday-hating {animal} has since abated, leaving even a former {name} fan like me flummoxed as to
  who the target audience would possibly be for this new venture: BlogTO proudly announces that “Toronto is getting

story_text: >
  What can I say about the 571B {noun} Slicer that hasn't already been said about the wheel, {noun_2}, or the
  iPhone.... this is one of the greatest {plural_noun} of all time. My husband and I would {verb} constantly
  over who had to {verb_2} the day's {noun} slices. It's one of those chores NO ONE wants to do! You know,
  the old "I spent the entire day {verb_ends_in_ing} OUR children, maybe YOU can {verb_3} a little and cut these
  {noun}s?" and of course, "You think I have the energy to {verb_4} your damn {noun}s? I {verb_past_tense} a 12
  hour shift just to come home to THIS?!" These are the things that can destroy an entire {noun_3}. It got to the
  point where our children could {verb_5} the tension. The minute I heard our 6-year-old girl in her bedroom,
  re-enacting our daily {noun_4} fight with her Barbie dolls, I knew we had to make a change. That's when I
  found the 571B {noun} Slicer. Our marriage has never been {noun_5}-ier, AND we've even {verb_past_tense_2} it
  into our lovemaking. THANKS 571B {noun} SLICER!

  Premade {noun}s are for {plural_noun}. If you really want to {verb} the {noun} thing, you have to {verb_2}
  your own. Personally, I prefer {proper_noun}'s {adjective} {noun}. I worship a giant {adjective_2} statue

  system whereby I strive to foster as much {proper_noun} as possible in myself. I believe that when we die,

  the next life. Everyone else is doomed to a cycle of birth and rebirth as a {noun_2}. As far as I can tell,
